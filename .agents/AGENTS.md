# Rule: Systematic Probing & Diagnostic Discipline

When encountering deployment, routing, or environment errors (e.g., 403, 404, 500, TLS/Auth failures), the agent must proceed strictly step-by-step through a bottom-up network and permission validation sequence before proposing code modifications or configuration writes:

## 1. Trace the Error Source
- Distinguish between Edge errors (e.g., GFE headers like "x-served-by" or server name headers) and application-layer exceptions.
- Execute lightweight fetch/curl scripts mapping the exact headers and caching controls of the failing request.

## 2. Test One Variable at a Time
- Never attempt to fix credentials, routing, and code paths simultaneously.
- Isolate the layers in this exact sequence:
  1. DNS Propagation (nslookup/host checks)
  2. TLS Handshake & SSL Certificates (verify active Cert subject/expiration)
  3. Edge Routing and Domain Mapping (check mappings across staging/prod panels)
  4. Ingress & IAM invoker permissions (verify Cloud Run access controls)
  5. Application logic/environment variables

## 3. Verify Every Assumption Programmatically
- Write local scratch scripts to parse JSON configurations, environment flags, and active API tokens rather than predicting behaviour.
- Validate that the staging and production contexts are completely isolated from one another before deploying changes.

## 4. Zero Guessing & Native Diagnostics
- Never guess the presence of system tools (like `gcloud` or `firebase` CLI) in the development shell.
- When querying remote platform status, inspect active config directories (`~/.config/configstore/firebase-tools.json`) programmatically.
- Avoid calling Node `fetch` on Windows development runtimes for token or log requests to prevent network engine crashes (`UV_HANDLE_CLOSING`). Instead, construct clean payload requests using Node's native `https` module.

# Deployment Milestones
- **2026-06-29**: v1.1.0-beta. Resolved dynamic Einstein template hydration, automated client-side cloning, multi-core GCF FFmpeg processing execution, and structured telemetry reporting. (Build Verify: SUCCESS)
